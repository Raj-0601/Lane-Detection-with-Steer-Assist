# Lane Detection with Steer Assist and Lane Departure Monitoring
## Project Description & Objective
This project was created to demonstrate how a lane detection system works on cars equipped with a front facing camera. Finding a place in more and more vehicles, this system is an essential part of the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) used in autonomous / semi-autonomous vehicles. This feature is responsible for detecting lanes, measuring curve radius (tightness of a curve) and monitors the offset from center. With this information, the system significantly improves safety by making sure the vehicle is centered inside the lane lines, as well as adds comfort if it is also configured to control the steering wheel to take gentle curves on highways without any driver input. This is a simplified version of what is used in production vehicles, and best functions if good conditions are provided (clear lane lines, stable light conditions). In this repository, it is included a dash cam footage for the script to work with.
